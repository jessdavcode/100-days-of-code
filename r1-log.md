### Day 1: January 23, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Used the MIT App Inventor to create a simple dice app and an interactive zoo animal identifier app (as part of my Mobile App Development course!).

**Thoughts:** Was really interesting to use blocks of code as opposed to actually writing the code out myself, but helped me to understand the logic behind each decision and also to see some examples of more complex coding abilities.

**Link to work:** Dice app: ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/?galleryId=4864226870558720 Zoo app is not published yet as tomorrow's lecture will continue building upon today's framework!
