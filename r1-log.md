# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Dav

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on January 23, 2020.

## Log

### Day 1: January 23, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Used the MIT App Inventor to create a simple dice app and an interactive zoo animal identifier app (as part of my Mobile App Development course!).

**Thoughts:** Was really interesting to use blocks of code as opposed to actually writing the code out myself, but helped me to understand the logic behind each decision and also to see some examples of more complex coding abilities.

**Link to work:** Dice app: ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/?galleryId=4864226870558720 Zoo app is not published yet as tomorrow's lecture will continue building upon today's framework!


### Day 2: January 24, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Used the MIT App Inventor to build on my zoo animal identifier app - using external scanners today (as part of my Mobile App Development course!).

**Thoughts:** Learning a lot of the same logical flow commands I've already learned in the past but being presented the information in a new way is helping to solidify it, which is great! Still weird to be using blocks, doesn't feel like real coding, but is really helping me to wrap my head around commands etc.

**Link to work:** Still unpublished for this app. Will update when it's published. Also cleared up my twitter account so I can start linking to daily tweets this weekend!


### Day 3: January 25, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Added a database to the zoo animal identifier app using TinyDB.

**Thoughts:** Great to finally integrate a database and see how the variable system works with TinyDB. 

**Link to work:** Still unpublished for this app. Will update when it's published. Twitter: [twitter.com/jesssdav]


### Day 4: January 26, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished app code blocks - downloaded APK and went through process to release on app store (testing, debugging etc).

**Thoughts:** So cool to see how the Google Play store works!

**Link to work:** Still unpublished for this app but about to be on the Google Play store! I will publish on MIT AI tomorrow. Twitter: [twitter.com/jesssdav]


### Day 5: January 27, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Looked at monetisation of apps and played around with some HTML and CSS for my business website.

**Thoughts:** I'm using Wix to build the site but the advanced website builder really lets me get into the actual coding and has been very interesting (and much nicer than just using the predesigned templates etc!). Once I have some articles online tomorrow/Thursday I will be able to style it a lot nicer and be more functional.

### Day 6: January 28, 2020

**Today's Progress:** More business website work, litle bit of debugging code!

**Thoughts:** The parts of the site I coded today aren't live yet but should be by next week! I'm setting up templates for use in automating blog articles. Debugged a bit of code I found to mass delete social media posts (trying to clean everything up!). Was a bit overwhelming - nice, clean code was appreciated but still wasn't entirely sure what wasn't working.

### Day 7: January 29, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Debugging Twitter code

**Thoughts:** Wasn't entirely writing code today - just trying to figure out why the mass tweet delete code isn't working in my favour. A lot of trawling through StackExchange and random internet forums about twitter archive etc.

### Day 8: January 30, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Debugging! I think we're almost there. Only 5000 left to delete.

**Thoughts:** It just keeps crashing part way through - but I did manage to get majority of it completed so I don't think I'm far off finishing :D

### Day 9: January 31, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished module 1 of Mobile App Development course! App is done.

**Thoughts:** Finally able to publish my Zoo App! Wil be looking at Play Store in the next module I believe and starting Java, which is really exciting.

### Day 10: February 1, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished the mass deletion of my twitter using Glitch code!!!

**Thoughts:** An exhausting process that took three days (four?) total - I am so glad it's finally done. Was interesting to try and export to GitHub and have Glitch not want to co-operate for a while.
