# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Created Hello World repository on GitHub, started working through FreeCodeCamp from the start and completed HTML module.

**Thoughts:** Really glad I followed the Hello World guide as I now understand GitHub a lot better! FreeCodeCamp feels quite basic as I learned these skills almost a decade ago but I really need this refresher, and am glad I've committed to this for the next few months.
