# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Created Hello World repository on GitHub, started working through FreeCodeCamp from the start and completed HTML module.

**Thoughts:** Really glad I followed the Hello World guide as I now understand GitHub a lot better! FreeCodeCamp feels quite basic as I learned these skills almost a decade ago but I really need this refresher, and am glad I've committed to this for the next few months.

### Day 2: December 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed CSS basics module on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Gained some new perspective on CSS! Whenever I've used it before or even worked through the same module I just did today, I didn't quite understand some of the terminology. Having worked with other languages and now being more familiar with the jargon, I found it a lot easier to understand the concepts presented and worked through it quite enjoyably. Spent two hours on it today!

### Day 3: December 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed Applied Visual Design module on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Similar to yesterday, this offered a new perspective on things I already knew and helped my brain to fully absorb their possible uses. Now I not only understand the theory behind what I learned today, but also the practical uses.
