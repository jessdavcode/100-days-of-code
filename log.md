# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: December 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Created Hello World repository on GitHub, started working through FreeCodeCamp from the start and completed HTML module.

**Thoughts:** Really glad I followed the Hello World guide as I now understand GitHub a lot better! FreeCodeCamp feels quite basic as I learned these skills almost a decade ago but I really need this refresher, and am glad I've committed to this for the next few months.

### Day 2: December 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed CSS basics module on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Gained some new perspective on CSS! Whenever I've used it before or even worked through the same module I just did today, I didn't quite understand some of the terminology. Having worked with other languages and now being more familiar with the jargon, I found it a lot easier to understand the concepts presented and worked through it quite enjoyably. Spent two hours on it today!

### Day 3: December 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed Applied Visual Design module on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Similar to yesterday, this offered a new perspective on things I already knew and helped my brain to fully absorb their possible uses. Now I not only understand the theory behind what I learned today, but also the practical uses.

### Day 4: December 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Half of Applied Accessibility module on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Honestly, I only made it through half of the module because it's 1am and I've had a big day. Nearly didn't do anything but am committed to this, even if I cannot manage any more! I will make up for it tomorrow. Is useful content to know and be aware of, but also not that different to the past three days as far as how everything works, just a few new terminologies. Looking forward to applying it all to the certification projects in a few days time!

### Day 5: December 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished Applied Accessibility, Responsive Web Design Principles, CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid modules on FreeCampCode.

**Thoughts:** Made up for last night's slow progress by blitzing through it tonight. Excited that tomorrow I will be starting the projects for the Responsive Web Design certification and actually putting my skills to the test.

### Day 6: December 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Responsive Web Design Project - Build a Tribute Page on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Really interesting project - used the template given in Codepen, which is a new site for me. Took a little bit of fiddling around to figure out how it all worked and my screen didn't really like the split view but I made it work. Spent an hour working out Codepen and doing the required HTML and CSS to pass the 10 tests, then spent the next hour fiddling around with some styles and importing information and links, etc. Still not finished! But will be tomorrow. Yes, I missed a day. I was going to count the 2 hours today for yesterday and today's progress but that feels too much like cheating, so I'll just keep at it. Rules say I can miss one day every 14 so I am not too fussed :)

### Day 7: December 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Responsive Web Design Project - Build a Tribute Page on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Very basic website but submitted and finished for this certification! Tomorrow will be starting the survey form which will use a lot more of the skills shown in the past week.
